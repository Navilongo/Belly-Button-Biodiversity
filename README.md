# plotly-challenge

In this project, I will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Purpose

Using the plotly library within Javascript and an HTML website, we want to design and build graphs that will assist us in better understanding the amounts and types of microbial species present in belly buttons (ewww!).

The site should contain a drop down menu where the user may elect a specifc person by ID. 

The site should also contain a horizontal graph, a gauge and a circles graph that would better explain the biodiversity in the elected ID.
